## 🔧 Technologies

### 🖥️ Client (src/client) 

* Framework: Vite (with HTML + TypeScript)
* NPM packages:
  * xash3d-fwgs 
  * cs16-client
* Uses WebRTC to connect to the dedicated server

### 🎮 Server (src/server) 

* Language: Go (Golang) + CGO
* Embedded: Xash3D FWGS (dedicated server)
* Network: Pion WebRTC library
* Serves static files for the client frontend

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🎮 Game Content (Required)

To run the game, you must provide original **Counter-Strike 1.6 game files** from Steam. These must be packaged in a `valve.zip` file and mounted into the Docker container.

### 📦 `valve.zip` Structure

```plaintext
valve.zip
├── valve/
└── cstrike/
```

The `valve.zip` file must contain the following two directories from your Steam installation:

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Docker installed
* A public IP address (if hosting outside LAN)
* An open UDP port (e.g. 27018)

You must mount the file to the container path `/xashds/public/valve.zip`:

```shell
docker build -t cs-web-server .
docker run -d \
  -p 27016:27016 \
  -p <your-port>:<your-port>/udp \
  -e IP=<your-public-ip> \
  -e PORT=<your-port> \
  -v $(pwd)/valve.zip:/xashds/public/valve.zip \
  cs-web-server \
  +map de_dust +maxplayers 14
```

Replace the placeholders:

* `<your-public-ip>` — your server's external IP
* `<your-port>` — open UDP port (e.g. 27018)

Then open `http://<your-server-ip>:27016` in your browser!

| `PORT`                 | UDP port for CS server (must be open)                                       | `27018`             |
| `DISABLE_X_POWERED_BY`| Set to `true` to remove the `X-Powered-By` HTTP header                       | `true`              |
| `X_POWERED_BY_VALUE`   | Custom value for `X-Powered-By` header if not disabled                      | `CS 1.6 Web Server` |

## 🛠️ Customization

* Client UI/UX: Modify files in src/client

 
To include custom plugins:
* Mount a volume to /xashds inside the container
* Or copy plugin files into the Docker build context
